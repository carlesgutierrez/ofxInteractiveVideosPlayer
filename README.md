# ofxInteractiveVideosPlayer
An OF addon that manage and control several videos at same time with Hap or QT Codecs

Several videos (Hap or other standart dodecs can be used, but I recomend to use HAP because it runs in the GPU) are loaded from a folder and can be played (tray drag and drop and right and left keys)

Mouse in visible in Window mode (press ENTER)
Gui is visible and hide by pressing ´g´

TODO: Create more interaction modes
