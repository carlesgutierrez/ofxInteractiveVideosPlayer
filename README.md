# ofxInteractiveVideosPlayer
An OF addon that manage and control several videos at same time with Hap or other QT Codecs (Check ExternalsConfig.h defines)

First to install HAP codecs check ofxHapPlayer dependencies (https://github.com/bangnoise/ofxHapPlayer) or this site from VDMX (http://vdmx.vidvox.net/blog/hap?ref=home)

Several videos (Hap or other standart dodecs can be used, but I recomend to use HAP because it runs in the GPU) are loaded from a folder and can be played (tray drag and drop and right and left keys)

Mouse in visible in Window mode (press ENTER)
Gui is visible and hide by pressing ´g´

TODO: Create more interaction modes

(Only tested in Mac OSX)
